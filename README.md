# A working lift code in VHDL

The code represents basic functions for working of a lift for 3 floors (top, middle, ground). This includes moving up/down, stopping at the floor called by the user and handling corner cases like not allowing downward movement at the ground floor and not allowing upward movement at the top floor.
